# Benchmark

***Benchmark are set to quicly evolve. I have currently multiple ideas to improve performance.***

## Command

You can run `zig build benchmark` if you clone the repo to benchmark your machine. [More info.](/ZipponDB/build)

Here an example on my machine:

```

=====================================
```

## File Parsing

In this example I create a random dataset of Users using this schema:
```lua
User (
  name: str,
  age: int,
  email: str,
  bday: date,
  last_order: datetime,
  a_time: time,
  scores: []int,
  friends: []str,
)
```

Here a user example:
```lua
run "ADD User (name = 'Diana Lopez',age = 2,email = 'allisonwilliams@example.org',scores=[37 85 90 71 88 85 68],friends = [],bday=1973/11/13,last_order=1979/07/18-15:05:26.590261,a_time=03:04:06.862213)
```

Let's do a query that parse all file but dont return anything, so we have the time to read and evaluate file but not writting and sending output.
```lua
run "GRAB User {name = 'asdfqwer'}"
```

## 50 000 000 Users
This take 6.24GB space on disk.
