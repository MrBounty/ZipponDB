# 50 000 000 users

In this example I create a random dataset of 50 000 000 Users using this shema:
```
TODO
```

Here a user example:
```
run "ADD User (name = 'Diana Lopez',age = 2,email = 'allisonwilliams@example.org',scores=[37 85 90 71 88 85 68],friends = [],bday=1973/11/13,last_order=1979/07/18-15:05:26.590261,a_time=03:04:06.862213)
```

First let's do a query that parse all file but dont return anything, so we have the time to read and evaluate file but not writting and sending output.
```
run "GRAB User {name = 'asdfqwer'}
```

### 50 000 000 Users
This take 6.24GB space on disk, seperated into xx files of xx MB

## TODO

- [ ] Benchmark per files size, to find the optimal one. For 10kB, 5MB, 100MB, 1GB
- [ ] Create a build command to benchmark. For 1_000, 1_000_000, 50_000_000 users
    - [ ] Create a random dataset
    - [ ] Do simple query, get average and +- time by set of 25 query
    - [ ] Return the data to do a chart
